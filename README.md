```

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Service-Based Architecture**: Business logic separated into injectable services
- **Component Lifecycle Management**: Proper use of `OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`, and `OnAfterRenderAsync`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services registered and injected following ASP.NET Core patterns
- **Async/Await Throughout**: All data operations use async patterns for performance
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Consistent UI with responsive Bootstrap components

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **.NET 9.0**: Target framework
- **Blazor Server**: Interactive web UI framework
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive design
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Radar chart rendering
- **JSON Configuration**: File-based competency framework definitions
- **Browser LocalStorage**: Client-side data persistence

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CompetencyApp
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Build the Application

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 4. Access the Application

1. Navigate to the homepage to see available competency frameworks
2. Click on any framework to start an assessment
3. Use the navigation menu to switch between assessments and radar charts

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Conducting Assessments

1. **Select Framework**: Choose Software Engineer or QA Engineer from the navigation
2. **Rate Skills**: Use the sliders to rate yourself on the 1-5 Dreyfus scale
3. **Add Notes**: Document specific examples and learning goals
4. **View Progress**: Check the competency summary for overall progress

### Visualizing Results

1. **Radar Charts**: Navigate to the radar chart for visual representation
2. **Growth Areas**: Review recommendations for skill development
3. **Export Data**: Download assessments for portfolio or review purposes

### Data Management

- **Automatic Saving**: All changes are saved to browser local storage immediately
- **Framework Isolation**: Each competency type maintains separate data
- **Export Options**: JSON exports include full assessment data with timestamps

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Competency Frameworks

1. **Create JSON Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Project Manager competency
   touch wwwroot/data/PMCompetency.json
   ```

2. **Follow Schema Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "sliders": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "project_planning",
         "label": "Project Planning",
         "minValue": 1,
         "maxValue": 5,
         "defaultValue": 3,
         "category": "Planning & Strategy",
         "description": "Project planning and execution",
         "levels": [
           {
             "level": 1,
             "name": "Novice",
             "description": "Basic project planning understanding",
             "characteristics": ["Follows templates", "Needs guidance"]
           }
           // ... additional levels
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Update Display Names** (Optional):
   ```csharp
   // In Services/SliderService.cs
   public string GetCompetencyDisplayName(string competencyType)
   {
       return competencyType switch
       {
           "SE" => "Software Engineer",
           "QA" => "QA Engineer",
           "PM" => "Project Manager", // Add new mapping
           _ => competencyType
       };
   }
   ```

4. **Test**: The framework will be automatically detected and appear in navigation

### Code Standards

- **Async Operations**: All service calls must use `async/await`
- **Component Lifecycle**: Use appropriate lifecycle methods for data loading
- **Bootstrap Classes**: Use Bootstrap utilities for consistent styling
- **Error Handling**: Include try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **Local Storage**: Use competency-specific keys for data isolation
