### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Service-Based Architecture**: Business logic separated into injectable services
- **Component Lifecycle Management**: Proper use of `OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`, and `OnAfterRenderAsync`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services registered and injected following ASP.NET Core patterns
- **Async/Await Throughout**: All data operations use async patterns for performance
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Consistent UI with responsive Bootstrap components

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **.NET 9.0**: Target framework
- **Blazor Server**: Interactive web UI framework
- **Azure OpenAI**: AI-powered competency improvement suggestions
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive design
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Radar chart rendering
- **JSON Configuration**: File-based competency framework definitions
- **Browser LocalStorage**: Client-side data persistence

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider recommended)
- Azure OpenAI instance (for AI suggestions feature)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CompetencyApp
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Configure Azure OpenAI

To enable AI-powered suggestions, configure your Azure OpenAI credentials:

**Option A: Using appsettings.Development.json (Recommended for local development)**

Create or update `appsettings.Development.json` with your Azure OpenAI settings:

```json
{
  "AzureOpenAI": {
    "Endpoint": "https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/",
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key",
    "DeploymentName": "your-deployment-name"
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: `appsettings.Development.json` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.

**Option B: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for production)**

```bash
export AzureOpenAI__Endpoint="https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/"
export AzureOpenAI__ApiKey="your-api-key"
export AzureOpenAI__DeploymentName="your-deployment-name"
```

### 3. Build the Application

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 5. Access the Application

1. Navigate to the homepage to see available competency frameworks
2. Click on any framework to start an assessment
3. Use the navigation menu to switch between assessments and radar charts
4. On the Radar Chart page, click "Get AI Suggestions" for personalized improvement recommendations

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Building and Running with Docker

#### Option 1: Build and Run Locally

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t competency-app:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 competency-app:latest
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

#### Option 2: Run with Environment Variables (for Azure OpenAI)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e AzureOpenAI__Endpoint="https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/" \
  -e AzureOpenAI__ApiKey="your-api-key" \
  -e AzureOpenAI__DeploymentName="your-deployment-name" \
  competency-app:latest
```

#### Option 3: Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  competency-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
      - AzureOpenAI__Endpoint=${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
      - AzureOpenAI__ApiKey=${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - AzureOpenAI__DeploymentName=${AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
```

Then run:

```bash
# Create a .env file with your Azure OpenAI settings
echo "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/" > .env
echo "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key" >> .env
echo "AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name" >> .env

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

### Pushing to AWS

#### Step 1: Create AWS ECR Repository

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name competency-app --region us-east-1
```

#### Step 2: Tag and Push Image

```bash
# Get your AWS account ID
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
REGION=us-east-1
REGISTRY=${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com

# Login to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION} | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${REGISTRY}

# Tag the image
docker tag competency-app:latest ${REGISTRY}/competency-app:latest

# Push to ECR
docker push ${REGISTRY}/competency-app:latest
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to AWS App Runner

1. Go to [AWS App Runner Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner)
2. Click "Create an App Runner service"
3. Select "Container registry"
4. Choose ECR and select your `competency-app` repository
5. Configure:
   - **Port**: 8080
   - **Environment variables**: Add your Azure OpenAI credentials
   - **CPU/Memory**: 1 vCPU, 2 GB (sufficient for this app)
6. Click "Create & Deploy"

Estimated monthly cost: **$5-20** depending on usage

#### Step 4: Alternative - Deploy to Lightsail

1. Go to [AWS Lightsail Console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com)
2. Click "Create instance" → "Container service"
3. Upload your `Dockerfile`
4. Configure same environment variables
5. Deploy

Estimated monthly cost: **$3.50-5** (cheapest option)

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Conducting Assessments

1. **Select Framework**: Choose Software Engineer or QA Engineer from the navigation
2. **Rate Skills**: Use the sliders to rate yourself on the 1-5 Dreyfus scale
3. **Add Notes**: Document specific examples and learning goals
4. **View Progress**: Check the competency summary for overall progress

### Visualizing Results

1. **Radar Charts**: Navigate to the radar chart for visual representation
2. **Growth Areas**: Review recommendations for skill development
3. **Export Data**: Download assessments for portfolio or review purposes

### Data Management

- **Automatic Saving**: All changes are saved to browser local storage immediately
- **Framework Isolation**: Each competency type maintains separate data
- **Export Options**: JSON exports include full assessment data with timestamps

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Competency Frameworks

1. **Create JSON Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Project Manager competency
   touch wwwroot/data/PMCompetency.json
   ```

2. **Follow Schema Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "sliders": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "project_planning",
         "label": "Project Planning",
         "minValue": 1,
         "maxValue": 5,
         "defaultValue": 3,
         "category": "Planning & Strategy",
         "description": "Project planning and execution",
         "levels": [
           {
             "level": 1,
             "name": "Novice",
             "description": "Basic project planning understanding",
             "characteristics": ["Follows templates", "Needs guidance"]
           }
           // ... additional levels
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Update Display Names** (Optional):
   ```csharp
   // In Services/SliderService.cs
   public string GetCompetencyDisplayName(string competencyType)
   {
       return competencyType switch
       {
           "SE" => "Software Engineer",
           "QA" => "QA Engineer",
           "PM" => "Project Manager", // Add new mapping
           _ => competencyType
       };
   }
   ```

4. **Test**: The framework will be automatically detected and appear in navigation

### Code Standards

- **Async Operations**: All service calls must use `async/await`
- **Component Lifecycle**: Use appropriate lifecycle methods for data loading
- **Bootstrap Classes**: Use Bootstrap utilities for consistent styling
- **Error Handling**: Include try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **Local Storage**: Use competency-specific keys for data isolation

### Azure OpenAI Configuration

The AI suggestions feature requires an Azure OpenAI instance. Configure the following settings:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `Enabled` | Enable/disable AI suggestions feature | `true` or `false` |
| `Endpoint` | Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint | `https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/` |
| `ApiKey` | API key from Azure Portal | `abc123...` |
| `DeploymentName` | Name of your deployed model | `gpt-35-turbo-1106` |

> **Note**: Set `Enabled` to `false` in `appsettings.json` (default) and `true` in `appsettings.Development.json` to only enable AI features when credentials are configured.

**Supported Models**: The application is tested with GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 deployments.

### Application Settings
Configuration is managed through `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.

- `appsettings.json` - Contains placeholder values, safe to commit
- `appsettings.Development.json` - Contains your actual credentials, excluded from git
